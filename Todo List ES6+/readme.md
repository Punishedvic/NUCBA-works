I know, you'll think "a todo-list is overrated" and I thought the same before seeing and understanding this new approach. Following a model made by a mentor from NUCBA, @Fd1az, I've made a todo list that focus on performance and clear code.
If you check the javascript code, you'll see that the application is handled in a way that is highly scalable and easy to read, setting the logical functioning in one side and the render on another one.
It has a very small html (thinking about how the apps are made in React) and the javascript code is separated between handler functions, render functions, selectors and an init function that starts it all.
